## A brief summary of Bi622 Demultiplexing Assignment 3 - Cameron Watson

script: demultiplex.py

output: demultiplex_stats.txt

slurm script: dplex.srun

slurm standard out: dplex_slurm.out

Note: As of August, 7 2020, demultiplex.py is functional but very much a rough draft.
I plan to refactor quite a bit.

See dplex.srun for the specific options that demultiplex.py was run with.

## Quality Cut-off justification

If either index for a given read pair contained any nucleotide with a quality score
of less than Q30, the entire read pair was parsed into the unknown/low quality file.
This was chosen partly based on the plot from Assignment 1 of index quality score 
distributions, and partly because indices should have a very stringent cut-off. 
An error in an index could potentially be the difference between a control sample
and a treatment sample. Additionally, a mean of Q30 did not seem appropriate because an
index could have a mean q-score of Q30, but still contain low confidence bases. This
decision resulted in a very high percentage of low-quality indices which would be
excluded from analysis. If I were to have done this again, I might have chosen a slightly
more lenient cut-off but I suppose this errs on the side of caution.
